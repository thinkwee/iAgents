## üìñ Overview

- **iAgents** is a platform **towards creating a world interwind by humans and agents**, where each human has a personal **agent** that can work on behalf the human to cooperate with other humans' agent. It is a new paradiam for [Large Language Model-powered Multi-Agent Systems](). **iAgents** proactively interact with human users to exchange information, while autonomously communicating with other agents to eliminate information asymmetry and collaborate effectively to accomplish tasks ([see our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14928)).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

- **iAgents** feature an instant messaging web UI that users can utilize as a conventional chat application, with each user automatically equipped with a personal agent. Messages beginning with '@' are automatically transformed into collaborative task commands, prompting the agents of both chat participants to engage and resolve the task through autonomous communication.
- Here is a quick start to use **iAgents**. You need to prepare
   -  [Python environment of version 3.9 or higher](https://docs.anaconda.com/working-with-conda/environments/)
   -  [MySQL environment]()
   -  [OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)
- Then, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:** Begin by cloning the repository using the command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thinkwee/iAgents.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment:** Ensure you have a version 3.9 or higher Python environment. You can create and
   activate this environment using the following commands, replacing `iAgents` with your preferred environment
   name:

   ```
   conda create -n iAgents python=3.9 -y
   conda activate iAgents
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Move into the `iAgents` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```
   cd iAgents
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set config file:** set your config file ``config/global.yaml`` by filling out
   -  backend.openai_api_key
   -  mysql.username
   -  mysql.password

   These are necessary parts for starting **iAgents**. Introduction for the full config file please see [here]()
5. **prepare your dataset** run the python script to create a mysql database for storing the messages, users, friendships and feedback tables in the **iAgents**
   ```
   python3 create_database.py
   ```

6. **Start!** simply by executing
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ```
   to start the IM UI of **iAgents**. Just invite your friend to register on the website, add them and chat with them! **Add @ before your message** and see what will happen!

## üó∫Ô∏è RoadMap
-  **iAgents** aims to explore a new Multi-Agent paradigm, where the value of agents is attributed to its human user's information, enhancing collaborative efficiency between humans and agents in coexistent societies. Currently, iAgents is in the academic prototype stage. **‚ö†Ô∏è Please do not use it in production environments.** We will continuously improve the functionality of **iAgents**. Below is our current roadmap, ordered from short-term to long-term goals:

   - [ ] Dockerfile
   - [ ] Support uploading files as human user information source
   - [ ] Customizable human information access authorization
   - [ ] InfoNav visualizer
   - [ ] Agent Cultivate
   - [ ] Add more preset databases for experience
   - [ ] Fuzzy memory
   - [ ] Enable agents proactively raising new communication
   - [ ] Switching between different agent types (structure/prompts/information access range)
   - [ ] Customizable reasoning class
   - [ ] Distributed deployment
   - [ ] Edge-side model support
