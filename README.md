## 📖 Overview

- **iAgents** is a platform towards creating a world where human and agent coexist for cooperation. Each human user in the **iAgents** will have a **agent** which can work on behalf the human to cooperate with other users' agent. It is a new paradiam for [Large Language Model-powered Multi-Agent Systems]().
-  It seems like a IM website and you can just chat on it. When you add '@' before your message, this message will be turned into a task instruction and you will have your agent summoned and cooperate with your friend's agent to solve it.
