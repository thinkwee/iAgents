<summary> 2024.7.12 ✅ iAgents now supports Llama Index!</summary>

*  2024.7.12 ✅ iAgents now supports [Llama Index](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/)! You can now upload files and your agent will retrieve them automatically to communicate and solve problems! Choose your favorite Huggingface Embedding Model and use Ollama local LLM for query response (support OpenAI soon). Just set your ``config/global.yaml`` like:
      <p align="center">
         <img src='./static/withllamaindex.png' width=800>
      </p>
      <p align="center">
         <img src='./static/show_files.png' width=800>
      </p>

      ```yaml
      agent:
         use_llamaindex: True
      ```

      You can 📃upload、🔍show and ❌delete your personal files provided to your agent. For example, ross here upload a file about emnlp papers, now your agent can ask ross's agent about the information of survey papers in emnlp (even though ross is a palaeontologist). ⚠️It is still a experimental function and we are working on it. See <a href="wiki.md#rag">guide here</a>.

<details>
<summary> 2024.7.11 ✅ iAgents now supports Ollama!</summary>

*  2024.7.11 ✅ iAgents now supports [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)! You can use localhost LLM simply by [installing Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and set config to pick up your favorite LLM in ``config/global.yaml``, for example, a qwen2 7b model:
      <p align="center">
         <img src='./static/withollama.png' width=800>
      </p>

      ```yaml
      backend:
         provider: ollama
         ollama_model_name: qwen2:7b
      ```

## 📖 Overview

- **iAgents** is a platform **designed to create a world weaved by humans and agents**, where each human has a personal **agent** that can work on their behalf to cooperate with other humans' agents. It is a new paradigm for [Large Language Model-powered Multi-Agent Systems](https://thinkwee.top/multiagent_ebook/index.html). **iAgents** proactively interact with human users to exchange information, while autonomously communicating with other agents to eliminate information asymmetry and collaborate effectively to accomplish tasks ([see our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14928)).

## ⚡️ Quickstart
- **iAgents** features an instant messaging web UI that users can utilize as a conventional chat application, with each user automatically equipped with a personal agent. Messages beginning with '@' are automatically transformed into collaborative task commands, prompting the agents of both chat participants to engage and resolve the task through autonomous communication.
- Here we have quick start guides to use **iAgents** in both shell and docker modes.

### 💻 Quickstart through Shell
1. You need to prepare:
   - [Python environment of version 3.9 or higher](https://docs.anaconda.com/working-with-conda/environments/)
   - [MySQL environment]()
   - [OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key)

2. **Clone the GitHub Repository:** Begin by cloning the repository using the command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thinkwee/iAgents.git
   ```

3. **Set Up Python Environment:** Ensure you have a version 3.9 or higher Python environment. You can create and activate this environment using the following commands, replacing `iAgents` with your preferred environment name:

   ```
   conda create -n iAgents python=3.9 -y
   conda activate iAgents
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:** Move into the `iAgents` directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```
   cd iAgents
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set Config File:** Set your iAgents config file ``config/global.yaml`` by filling out:
   - backend.openai_api_key
   - mysql.username
   - mysql.password

   These three config options are necessary for starting **iAgents**. For the full config file, please see [here](wiki.md#configuration).
6. **Initialize Your Database:** Run the Python script to create a MySQL database for storing the messages, users, friendships, and feedback tables in **iAgents**:
   ```
   python3 create_database.py
   ```

7. **Start:** Simply execute:
   ```
   python3 app.py
   ```
   to start the IM UI of **iAgents**. Invite your friend to register on the website, add them, and chat with them! **Add @ before your message** and see what happens!

### 🐳 Quickstart through Docker
1. Make sure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed.

2. **Clone the GitHub Repository:** Begin by cloning the repository using the command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/thinkwee/iAgents.git
   ```

3. **Set Config File:** Set your iAgents config file ``config/global.yaml`` by filling out:
   - backend.openai_api_key
   - mysql.username
   - mysql.password

   and set your docker env config file ``.env``. **Make sure the iAgents config is consistent with docker env config**.

   These three config options are necessary for starting **iAgents**. For the full config file, please see [here](wiki.md#configuration).

4. build docker container:

   ```
   cd iAgents
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **Start:** now you can visit the ``localhost:5001/login`` (by default) to start the IM UI of **iAgents**. Invite your friend to register on the website, add them, and chat with them! **Add @ before your message** and see what happens!


## 🗺️ Roadmap
- **iAgents** aims to explore a new Multi-Agent paradigm, where the value of agents is attributed to their human user's information, enhancing collaborative efficiency between humans and agents in coexistent societies. Currently, iAgents is in the academic prototype stage. **⚠️ Please do not use it in production environments.** We will continuously improve the functionality of **iAgents**. Below is our current roadmap, ordered from short-term to long-term goals:

   - [x] Dockerfile
   - [x] Support Ollama
   - [x] Support JinaReader
   - [x] Support llama_index
   - [x] Agent Cultivate
   - [ ] Customizable human information access authorization
   - [ ] InfoNav visualizer
   - [ ] Agent action status bar
   - [ ] Add more preset databases for experience
   - [ ] Fuzzy memory
   - [ ] Enable agents to proactively initiate new communication
   - [ ] Switching between different agent types (structure/prompts/information access range)
   - [ ] Customizable reasoning class
   - [ ] Distributed deployment
   - [ ] Edge-side model support
